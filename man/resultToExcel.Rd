\code{DatabaseConnector} package.}

\item{Concepts_in_cohortSet}{dataframe which stores cohorts and concept set definitions in a tabular format,
it should have the following columns:

\item{resultSchema}{schema containing Achilles results}

\description{
This function resolves concept sets in a SQL database
it uses an input of #' getNodeConcepts() funcion,
it detects non-standard concepts used in concept set expression;
also detects the changes in included concepts due to a vocabulary version change:
1) added or excluded source concepts due to changed mapping to standard concepts
2) added or excluded standard concepts due to hierarchy changes, only the "peak concepts" are shown
 "peak concept" is a concept above which the hierarchy is altered
3) domain changes of included standard concepts
The result is written to an excel file with the tab for each check

\examples{
\dontrun{
 resultToExcel(connectionDetails = YourconnectionDetails,
 Concepts_in_cohortSet = Concepts_in_cohortSet, # is returned by getNodeConcepts function
 newVocabSchema = "omopVocab_v1", #schema containing newer vocabulary version
 oldVocabSchema = "omopVocab_v0", #schema containing older vocabulary version
 resultSchema = "achillesresults") #schema with achillesresults
}
